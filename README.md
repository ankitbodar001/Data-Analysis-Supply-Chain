# Supply Chain Analysis Using Python

This project demonstrates how to analyze a company's supply chain using Python. It explores various stages of the supply chain, including sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, and sales, using data visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about a fashion and beauty startup's supply chain, including product prices, revenue, sales, lead time, manufacturing costs, shipping carriers, and defect rates.

## Features

- **Data Import and Preprocessing**: 
  - Load the dataset and generate descriptive statistics for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  - Transform and clean data for effective analysis.
  
- **Visualizations**:
  - Scatter plots to analyze product pricing and revenue generation.
  - Pie charts for product type sales and cost distribution by transportation modes.
  - Bar plots for revenue by shipping carriers and defect rates by product type.
  - Line charts to track SKU revenue, stock levels, and trends.

- **Insights**:
  - Identify revenue-generating products and shipping carriers.
  - Analyze defect rates by product type and transportation modes.
  - Evaluate average lead time and manufacturing costs by product category.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **Plotly Express**: To create streamlined visualizations.
- **Plotly Graph Objects**: For advanced chart customizations.
